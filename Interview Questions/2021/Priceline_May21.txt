Round 1: (Status Rejected)

* What is immutable class? How do we implement that? In detail with some followup questions.
* Internal structure of Hashmap? How do we implement hashcode and equals method?
  follow up: if we have 
  class Teacher{
    String name;
    }
   If any two teacher object will have same name, it should overwrite in hashmap. Where do you override your equals method?
* If you override in Teacher class, write the code.
* Implement singleton pattern with handling the race conditions.
