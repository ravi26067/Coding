# Trees

## Introduction #
In this chapter, we will learn a hierarchical data structure known as a Tree. A tree consists of nodes (vertices) that are connected using pointers (edges). Trees are similar to Graphs; the key differentiating point is that a cycle cannot exist in a Tree.

The basic structure of a tree consists of the following components:

**Nodes**: Hold data

**Root**: The uppermost node of a tree

**Parent Node**: A node which is connected to one or more nodes on the lower level (Child Nodes).

**Child Node**: A node which is linked to an upper node (Parent Node)

**Sibling Node**: Nodes that have the same Parent Node

**Leaf Node** : A node that doesnâ€™t have any Child Node

The figure below shows all the terminologies described above:
