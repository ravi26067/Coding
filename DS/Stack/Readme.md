### Stack Data Structure

A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates â€“ you add a plate to the top and remove the topmost plate.

#### Operations:

- **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Removes the element from the top of the stack.
- **Peek or Top:** Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
- **isEmpty:** Checks if the stack is empty.
- **size or count:** Returns the number of elements in the stack.

#### Implementation:

- Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
- Array implementation is straightforward, but it has a fixed size. When the stack reaches its limit, you may need to resize the array.
- Linked list implementation is dynamic and allows for easy resizing but involves more memory overhead.

#### Applications:

- Function call management (call stack in recursion)
- Expression evaluation (e.g., infix to postfix conversion)
- Undo mechanisms in applications
- Backtracking algorithms
- Managing memory in certain algorithms (e.g., depth-first search)

#### Time Complexity:

- Push, Pop, Peek, isEmpty, and size operations generally have a constant time complexity of O(1).

#### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack.

#### Example in Pseudocode (using array):

```plaintext
Stack: array of elements
Top: index of the top element (initially -1)

Push(element):
   Top++
   Stack[Top] = element

Pop():
   if isEmpty():
      return "Stack Underflow"
   else:
      element = Stack[Top]
      Top--
      return element

Peek():
   if isEmpty():
      return "Stack is empty"
   else:
      return Stack[Top]

isEmpty():
   return Top == -1

size():
   return Top + 1
```

Stacks are an integral part of many algorithms and are used in a wide range of applications due to their simplicity and efficiency. They provide a structured way to manage data and control the flow of execution in various computational processes.
