# Dynamic Programming

Many recursive algorithms are brute-force in nature, i.e., they explore the entire solution space, which is exponential in terms of the problem size. Often, the recursive algorithms re-evaluate the same sub-problem over and over, which is inefficient. Dynamic programming is a technique that might be used to provide more efficient solutions to such problems.

Dynamic programming is a technique to provide an efficient solution to a problem by avoiding recomputations. It only works on problems that have repeating subproblems. It is something every developer should have in their toolkit.

In this module, you will get invaluable practice on some essential dynamic programming practice problems. This will help you prepare for dynamic programming-related problems that are commonly asked in Java coding interviews.
